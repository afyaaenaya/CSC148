"""CSC148 Lab 3: Inheritance

=== CSC148 Summer 2023 ===

=== Module Description ===
This module contains the implementation of a simple number game.
The key class design feature here is *inheritance*, which is used to enable
different types of players, both human and computer, for the game.

    A count starts at 0. On a player's turn, they add to the count an amount
    between a set minimum and a set maximum. The player who brings the count
    to a set goal amount is the winner.

    The game can have multiple rounds.

    === Attributes ===
    goal:
        The amount to reach in order to win the game.
    min_step:
        The minimum legal move.
    max_step:
        The maximum legal move.
    current:
        The current value of the game count.
    players:
        The two players.
    turn:
        The turn the game is on, beginning with turn 0.
        If turn is even number, it is players[0]'s turn.
